Website
-------

The project's website with documentation is:
http://chemcoord.readthedocs.org/

Features
--------

-  Molecules are reliably transformed between cartesian space and non
   redundant internal coordinates (Zmatrices). Dummy atoms are inserted
   and removed automatically on the fly if necessary.
-  The created Zmatrix is not only a structure expressed in internal
   coordinates, it is a "chemical" Zmatrix. "Chemical" Zmatrix means,
   that e.g. distances are along bonds or dihedrals are defined as they
   are drawn in chemical textbooks (Newman projections).
-  Analytical gradients for the transformations between the different
   coordinate systems are implemented.
-  Performance intensive functions/methods are implemented with
   Fortran/C like speed using `numba <http://numba.pydata.org/>`__.
-  Geometries may be defined with symbolic expressions using
   `sympy <http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html>`__.
-  Built on top of `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ with very
   similar syntax. This allows for example distinct label or row based
   indexing.
-  It derived from my own work and I heavily use it during the day. So
   all functions are tested and tailored around the work flow in
   theoretical chemistry.
-  `It as a python module ;) <https://xkcd.com/353/>`__

Installation guide
------------------

A working python 3 installation is required (>=3.7 are possible).

It is highly recommended to use this module in combination with
`Ipython <http://ipython.org/>`__ and `jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`__.
They come shipped by default with the `anaconda3
installer <https://www.continuum.io/downloads/>`__

Unix
~~~~

For the packaged version, the following commands have to be executed in
the terminal:

::

   pip install chemcoord

For the up to date development version (experimental):

::

   git clone https://github.com/mcocdawc/chemcoord.git
   cd chemcoord
   pip install .

Windows
~~~~~~~

Neither installation nor running the module are tested on windows. To
the best of my knowledge it should work there as well. Just use the same
steps as for UNIX.


Citation and mathematical background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The theory behind chemcoord is described in `this paper <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcc.27029>`__.
